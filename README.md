# This software is deprecated and only usefull if you are using android 2.x

Please use https://github.com/danielegobbetti/ICSImport instead.

Reason:

The import code (or "Open with Calendar") of k3b/CalendarIcsAdapter is functional equivalent to the code
from danielegobbetti/ICSImport (because it was originally based on his code)

The Export code of this module ("Send Calendar Event To") is not callable from google-stock-calendar-app any more.
Instead google-stock-calendar-app has its own implementation of "Send Calendar Event To".

Version V1.5.8.160526 is the last version maintained by me

**CalendarIcsAdapter** is a small free and open source app for Android 2.1 and up
that converts between 
android calendar events and 
[calendar entry files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar) (`*.ics` or `*.ical`).

**Note:** CalendarIcsAdapter works best with [local android calendars](https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/org.sufficientlysecure.localcalendar)
and ics-files with only one event (or only a few). For cloud based calendars or google mail there may be other
tools available.

**Warning:** Importing ics-files with many event-entries is not recommended
(but possible since [bugfix#15](https://github.com/k3b/CalendarIcsAdapter/issues/15)).
This requires a lot of user-interaction and cannot be interrupted.

Use a filemanager (i.e. [org.openintents.filemanager](https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/org.openintents.filemanager)),
emailclient (i.e. [k9 mail](https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/com.fsck.k9)) or bluetooth to import or export
android calendar entries files or attachments.

The android.calendar.ics.adapter has no gui of its own. Instead it hooks into the android system.

* If you open an event from the android calendar you can choose between `view event` and `send event to ...`.
  * Selecting `Send Event to ...` allows you to send a calendar entry file to any installed android application that can handle file attachments. I.e.
    * android emailclient
    * bluetooth
    * [ToGoZip](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=de.k3b.android.toGoZip) to collect in a zipfile while beeing offline.
* If you open an event from file/attachment you get a prepopulated "add to calender-form". This works with
	* get an email invitation with an attached calendar entry
	* download a calendar entry file from a webpage
	* receive a calendar entry via bluetooth`(*)`
	* open a calendar entry file in a filemanager.

`(*)` there is an [android issue that blocks receiving `*.ics` files via bluetooth](https://github.com/k3b/CalendarIcsAdapter/issues/2). 
If you rename the fileextension from `*.ics` to `*.ical` it will work with android bluetooth.

## Permissions

* android.permission.READ_CALENDAR 
    * to export event data for export
* android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE 
    * to save event data to local file. This
    * must be readable by other apps to make SendTo work. Unfortunately FileProvider
    * does not work on my android 2.2 togehter with send to bluetooth.
	
At the moment CalendarIcsAdapter does not need calendar-write permissions.

When importing the original .ics file is 
parsed and the event is added using the native calendar application. 
This way you are free to change 
the event details before saving.
 
## Building

There are 3 branches in the git repository at https://github.com/k3b/CalendarIcsAdapter.git

* **master** ics-import only that requires no additional permisions based on [[org.dgtale.icsimport]]
* **development** current development version for android-studio
* **release-fdroid** official fdroid build version with gradle-build.
    * official fdroid releases are tagged with v*.*.* (for example v1.5.4)

The project should build as-is using

* gradle-2.13 and android-buildtools-23.0.1
  * `gradlew clean installRelease`
  * `gradlew clean installDebug`

The libraries contained  in this project are taken from the [ical4j project](http://ical4j.sf.net/).
A binary version of the app is [available](https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/de.k3b.android.calendar.ics.adapter) in the android opensource appstore [f-droid](https://f-droid.org/)

## Architecture

The CalendarIcsAdapter consists of 3 Layers:

* libIcs2se android independent calendar functions, that can run on android or on j2se.
    * EventDto Calendar-event-abstraction that is independant from Android-Calendar-Event and form iCal4j-VEvent-ics-Implementation. as java interface.
    * EventDtoSimple Minimal implementation of EventDto-interface to backup values of other EventDto-implementations.
    * IcsAsEventDto Facade that makes a ical4j-vevent implementation specific ics appear as EventDto.
    * EventDto2IcsFactory Factory that converts generic EventDto to iCal4j-Implementation specific ics.

* libIcs4Android Android specific calendar functions
    * ACalendarCursorAsEventDto* Let an android specific calendarEvent cursor appear as a EventDto: Interface, and implementatins for android 2.x and 4.x.
    * ACalendar2IcsEngine Android specific export engine that converts Android-Calendar-Event(s) to a ics-Calendar-Event string.
    * IcsImportIntent-Factory/Impl2/Impl4 converts an EventDto to and android specific event intend that opend a prepopulated Add-Event-to-Calendar-Form with implementation for android 2.x and 4.x.
    * ContentUriCursor->ACalendarCursor local database-content-helper
    * ACalendarMock sqLite database that can be used to mock android calendar contentprovider on emulator with no calendar.
    * compat.* support for android2 compatibility since CalendarApi officially requires android4 but works on many androd2.x

* app contains Android specific Activities that plugs into android
    * ACalendar2IcsActivity export a ics-calendar-event-file from the android Calendar.
    * ACalendar2IcalActivity export a ical-calendar-event-file from the android Calendar.
    * Ics2ACalendarActivity imports a ics-calendar-event-file into the android Calendar via propopulated Android-Create-Event-Form

### Dependencies:

  * app -> libIcs4Android -> libIcs2se -> iCal4j -> backport-util-concurrent + commons-codec + commons-lang
  * jUnit4-tests (j2se) -> libIcs2se -> iCal4j -> backport-util-concurrent + commons-codec + commons-lang
